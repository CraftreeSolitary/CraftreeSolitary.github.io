Hello! I am an undergraduate student at IIT Gandhinagar (Class of 2027) pursuing B.Tech. in Artificial Intelligence. 

My fascination with Probability and Statistics, sparkled by Professor Shanmuga's class during my second semester led me to delve deeper into Machine Learning. I am particularly intrigued by the Probabilistic Approaches. I am also interested in Computer Vision and Deep Learning.

To complement my theoretical knowledge, I'm currently working on improving my competitive programming skills and mastering the MERN Stack for web development.

Outside of academics, I love relaxing through swimming and gaming. 

When I need a break, I love getting lost in sci-fi movies, especially the work of Christopher Nolan. Music is also a constant companion; you can find me listening to a variety of genres. Here are some of my absolute favorites:

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
